# Insert Documents
There are 2 methods to insert documents into a MongoDB database.

# insertOne()
To insert a single document, use the insertOne() method.

This method inserts a single object into the database.

Note: When typing in the shell, after opening an object with curly braces "{" you can press enter to start a new line in the editor without executing the command. The command will execute when you press enter after closing the braces.

# Example
db.posts.insertOne({
  title: "Post Title 1",
  body: "Body of post.",
  category: "News",
  likes: 1,
  tags: ["news", "events"],
  date: Date()
})

Note: If you try to insert documents into a collection that does not exist, MongoDB will create the collection automatically.

insertMany()
To insert multiple documents at once, use the insertMany() method.

This method inserts an array of objects into the database.

# Example
db.posts.insertMany([  
  {
    title: "Post Title 2",
    body: "Body of post.",
    category: "Event",
    likes: 2,
    tags: ["news", "events"],
    date: Date()
  },
  {
    title: "Post Title 3",
    body: "Body of post.",
    category: "Technology",
    likes: 3,
    tags: ["news", "events"],
    date: Date()
  },
  {
    title: "Post Title 4",
    body: "Body of post.",
    category: "Event",
    likes: 4,
    tags: ["news", "events"],
    date: Date()
  }
])

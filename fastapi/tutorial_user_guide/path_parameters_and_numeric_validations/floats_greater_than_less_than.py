"""Number validations: floats, greater than and less than"""
Number validations also work for float values.

# Here's where it becomes important to be able to declare gt and not just ge.
# As with it you can require, for example, that a value must be greater than 0,
# even if it is less than 1.

# So, 0.5 would be a valid value. But 0.0 or 0 would not.

# And the same for lt.

# Multiple Body Parameters
# In the previous example, the path operation will expect a JSON body with attributes of an Item
# like:
"""
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2
}
"""

# But you can also declare multiple body parameters e.g. item and user
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    """Item Model"""
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None

class User(BaseModel):
    """User Model"""
    username: str
    full_name: str | None

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item, user: User):
    """Path Operation to Update Item"""
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item, "user": user}
    return results

# In this case, FastAPI will notice that there is more than one body parameter
# in the function (there are two parameters that are Pydantic models).
# So, it will then use the parameter names as keys (field names) in the body, and expect a body like

"""
{
    "item": {
        "name": "Foo",
        "description": "The pretender",
        "price": 42.0,
        "tax": 3.2
    },
    "user": {
        "username": "dave",
        "full_name": "Dave Grohl"
    }
}
"""

# Notice that even though the item was declared the same way as before,
# it is now expected to be inside of the body with a key item.
# FastAPI will do the automatic conversion from the request,
# so that the parameter item receives its specific content and the same for user.
# It will perform the validation of the compound data,
# and will document it like that for the OpenAPI schema and automatic docs.

"""Using Just list"""
# You can also use list directly instead of List[str] (or list[str] in Python 3.9+):
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(q: Annotated[list, Query()] = []):
    """Using just lists"""
    query_items = {"q": q}
    return query_items

# Keep in mind that in this case, FastAPI won't check the contents of the list.
# For example, List[int] would check (and document) that the contents of the list are integers.
# But list alone wouldn't.

# Create a New File
# To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

# "x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exists

# "a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

# "w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

# Example
# Create a file called "myfile.txt":

f = open("myfile.txt", "x")

# Result: a new empty file is created!

# Example
# Create a new file if it does not exist:

f = open("myfile.txt", "w")

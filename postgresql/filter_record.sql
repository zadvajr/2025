-- Filter Records
-- The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

-- It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

-- If we want to return only the records where city is London, we can specify that in the WHERE clause:

-- Example
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city = 'London';

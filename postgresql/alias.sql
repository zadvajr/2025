-- Aliases
-- SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

-- Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

-- An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

-- An alias is created with the AS keyword.

-- Example
-- Using aliases for columns:

SELECT customer_id AS id
FROM customers;

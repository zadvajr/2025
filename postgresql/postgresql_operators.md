>	Greater than
<=	Less than or equal to
>=	Greater than or equal to
<>	Not equal to
!=	Not equal to
LIKE	Check if a value matches a pattern (case sensitive)
ILIKE	Check if a value matches a pattern (case insensitive)
AND	Logical AND
OR	Logical OR
IN	Check if a value is between a range of values
BETWEEN	Check if a value is between a range of values
IS NULL	Check if a value is NULL
NOT	Makes a negative result e.g. NOT LIKE, NOT IN, NOT BETWEEN

# Delete Collection
# You can delete a table, or collection as it is called in MongoDB, by using the drop() method.

# Example
# Delete the "customers" collection:

import pymongo

myclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mydb = myclient["mydatabase"]
mycol = mydb["customers"]

mycol.drop()
# The drop() method returns true if the collection was dropped successfully, 
# and false if the collection does not exist.
